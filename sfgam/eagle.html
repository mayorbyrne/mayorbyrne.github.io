<h2 align="left">The American Eagle, the classic white coaster in
front of Great America. This rickety coaster will throw you from
your seat and shake you all the way to the end. Its massive 150
foot drop is one of the largest in the park, and this one goes
STRAIGHT down. The spirals in the middle of the ride let the
coaster pick up speed, and then you will go through a few more
mini-drops before ending. This is one classic that will take your
breath away. </h2>
