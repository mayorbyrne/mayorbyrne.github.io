    <li><p align="left"><font face="Subway"><u>River Rocker</u> -
        A cheesy ride located in Southwest territory. You sit in
        a canoe and fly back and forth, like the pirate ships you
        often see at carnivals. If you like to get a little
        queezy, go on it.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font face="Subway"><u>Hay Baler</u> -
        This ride is sometimes hard to locate. Nestled in the
        &quot;woods&quot;, it spins you around and around and
        around. A boring ride that is good to go on if you are
        waiting for someone on a ride.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font face="Subway"><u>Sky Whirl</u> - A
        classic ride at Six Flags. There has been some talk about
        removing it from the park. A three wayy &quot;ferris -
        wheel&quot; that lasts for about fifteen minutes. A great
        time - buyer.</font></p>
