<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Boulder">A great ride the
first couple of times you ride it. The year it opened it had 2
hour lines...OUCH! I went opening day 1998 and it had a 15 minute
wait. You'll have to check when you go, though. Be prepared to
wait for this one. I suspect that this year, the Giant Drop will
have very short lines. (Don't take my word for it, though!)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Boulder">Although thrilling,
this ride is over in less than 15 seconds, so don't be
disappointed if you were expecting something more. So dare to
ride the Giant Drop...you will soon find out it's a Giant Flop.</font></p>
