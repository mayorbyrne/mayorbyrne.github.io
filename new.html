RIDE...</strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#00FFFF"><strong>There is a new go
cart track with go carts near the new Dino-Island Adventure. I
think the price is too steep to ride in cheesy cars with
weed-whacker motors in 'em. My opinion....but it seemed like it
was getting a lot of business on the 16th. I believe it was $5 to
ride.</strong></font></p>
