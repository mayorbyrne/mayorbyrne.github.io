<p>The Whizzer is a particularly fun coaster to ride. There are
no high-tech lap and shoulder harnesses on this coaster, just a
little seat belt. The ride sits two people per seat, seated one
behind the other. This pleasurable coaster reaches higher speeds
than you would think and has thrilling spirals and an
easy-to-take first drop. </p>
