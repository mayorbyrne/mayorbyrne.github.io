<h2><font color="#FF0000">Batman...The Ride...</font></h2>

<h2><font color="#FFFF00">The line for this ride is the best in
the park, because you go through Gotham City. The ride is
excellent and fast, but over very quickly. The suspended chairs
make the ride, but the loops and corkscrews also help. The lift
itself is longer than the rest of the ride, but when I get off
the ride, I don't hear anybody complaining. A great thrill with
an unusual non-menacing wait.</font></h2>
