<ul>
    <li><font face="Scribble"><strong><u>Fiddler's Fling</u></strong><strong>
        - This is like &quot;teacups&quot; on steroids. Don't
        forget to bring a barf-bag!</strong></font></li>
    <li><font face="Scribble"><strong><u>Daredevil Dive</u></strong><strong>
        - Pay your way on (pretty expensive). Bungee Jump from
        about 120 feet. Pretty exciting, but I wouldn't do it
        again.</strong></font></li>
    <li><font face="Scribble"><strong><u>Logger's Run</u></strong><strong>
        - The best water ride at the park. A basic log flume ride
        gone mad. There are mini-drops during the ride and a
        towering one at the end. prepare to get soaking wet!</strong></font></li>
    <li><font face="Scribble"><strong><u>Whirligig</u></strong><strong>
        - This one made it to my ride of the month section before
        I stopped working on my page for about 3 or 4 months. An
        excellent ride to ride on at night, it is just a basic
        swing ride. I have fun on it, and I think you would too.</strong></font></li>
    <li><font face="Scribble"><strong><u>Yankee Clipper</u></strong><strong>
        - Another good water ride similar to Logger's Run, but
        you don't get as wet on this one. But, you better know
        what days this ride is open, because it is closed almost
        every time I go to the park.</strong></font></li>
